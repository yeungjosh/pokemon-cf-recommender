# How Collaborative Filtering Works for Pokémon Team Recommendations

## Overview

This project uses **item-item collaborative filtering** to recommend Pokémon trios that complete your competitive team. Unlike the ML-Hybrid approach (which uses domain knowledge + machine learning), this system learns purely from patterns in successful teams.

**Key Insight:** If Pokémon A and B frequently appear together on winning teams, and you have Pokémon A, then Pokémon B is likely a good recommendation.

## Why Collaborative Filtering?

### The Problem

Building a competitive Pokémon team requires balancing:
- **Type coverage** (resisting common attacks, hitting opponents' weaknesses)
- **Role diversity** (hazard setters, removers, pivots, speed control)
- **Meta matchups** (handling popular threats like Garchomp, Kingambit)

The ML-Hybrid approach solves this by explicitly modeling these factors with domain knowledge. But what if we could learn team patterns **without** hardcoding competitive rules?

### The Solution: Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering (CF) is the same algorithm Netflix uses to recommend movies: "Users who liked X also liked Y." In our case:

> **"Teams that used Pokémon X also used Pokémon Y."**

This approach:
- ✅ Requires **no domain knowledge** (no type charts, no role definitions)
- ✅ Adapts to **meta shifts** (learns from current team compositions)
- ✅ Discovers **unexpected synergies** (patterns humans might miss)
- ❌ Needs **training data** (synthetic teams in our case)

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Generate Training Data

We create 1,500 synthetic teams based on competitive archetypes:

```python
# Sample archetypes
archetypes = {
    "Balance": {
        "core": ["Landorus-Therian", "Toxapex", "Heatran"],
        "flexibles": ["Garchomp", "Corviknight", "Clefable"]
    },
    "Hyper Offense": {
        "core": ["Dragapult", "Iron Valiant", "Great Tusk"],
        "flexibles": ["Kingambit", "Raging Bolt"]
    },
    ...
}
```

Each team contains 6 Pokémon sampled from its archetype's core + flexibles. This creates realistic co-occurrence patterns.

**Example teams:**
```
Team 1: [Garchomp, Toxapex, Heatran, Corviknight, Landorus-Therian, Clefable]
Team 2: [Garchomp, Great Tusk, Raging Bolt, Kingambit, Iron Valiant, Dragapult]
Team 3: [Garchomp, Toxapex, Landorus-Therian, Clefable, Heatran, Rillaboom]
...
```

Notice how **Garchomp + Landorus-Therian** appear together frequently → high similarity.

### Step 2: Build Co-occurrence Matrix

Count how many times each Pokémon pair appears together:

```python
co_occurrence_matrix[i][j] = number of teams containing both Pokemon i and j
```

**Example (simplified):**
```
              Garchomp  Landorus-T  Dragapult  Toxapex
Garchomp         150       95          45         70
Landorus-T        95      140          30         85
Dragapult         45       30         120         25
Toxapex           70       85          25        130
```

Here, Garchomp appeared in 150 teams, and 95 of those also had Landorus-Therian.

### Step 3: Calculate Similarity Matrix

Use **cosine similarity** to normalize co-occurrence counts:

```python
similarity(A, B) = dot(row_A, row_B) / (||row_A|| * ||row_B||)
```

**Why cosine similarity?**
- Handles popularity bias (Garchomp appears in 150 teams, Toxapex in 130)
- Measures **pattern similarity**, not just raw counts
- Returns values in [0, 1] where 1 = always appear together

**Example similarity scores:**
```
sim(Garchomp, Landorus-T) = 0.68  # Very similar patterns
sim(Garchomp, Dragapult)  = 0.31  # Different archetypes
sim(Garchomp, Toxapex)    = 0.54  # Moderate similarity
```

### Step 4: Make Recommendations

Given a user's team `[Garchomp, Raging Bolt, Great Tusk]`:

1. **Find candidate Pokémon** (top 100 by usage, excluding user's team)
2. **Score each trio** of 3 candidates using:
   - **CF Similarity Score:** Average similarity between user's team and candidate trio
   - **Team Cohesion Score:** How well all 6 Pokémon work together
3. **Rank and return** top 5 recommendations

### Key Classes

#### 1. `CollaborativeFilteringModel` (`src/cf_model.py`)

Builds and stores the similarity matrix.

```python
class CollaborativeFilteringModel:
    def build_from_teams(self, teams: list[list[str]]):
        # Step 1: Build co-occurrence matrix
        for team in teams:
            for mon1, mon2 in combinations(team, 2):
                self.co_occurrence[idx1][idx2] += 1
                self.co_occurrence[idx2][idx1] += 1

        # Step 2: Calculate cosine similarity
        self.similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(self.co_occurrence)

    def get_similarity(self, mon1: str, mon2: str) -> float:
        # Returns similarity score between two Pokémon
        idx1 = self.pokemon_to_idx[mon1]
        idx2 = self.pokemon_to_idx[mon2]
        return self.similarity_matrix[idx1][idx2]
```

**Pre-training:**
- Model is trained once and saved to `models/cf_model.json`
- On first run, auto-trains if model not found
- Training takes ~15 seconds for 1,500 teams × 100 Pokémon

#### 2. `CFTeamRecommender` (`src/recommender.py`)

Scores candidate trios using the CF model.

```python
class CFTeamRecommender:
    def recommend(self, input_team: list[str], top_k: int = 5):
        # Get candidate pool (top 100 most-used Pokémon)
        candidates = self.get_candidates(exclude=input_team)

        # Score all possible trios
        recommendations = []
        for trio in combinations(candidates, 3):
            cf_score = self._cf_similarity_score(input_team, trio)
            team_cohesion = self._team_cohesion_score(input_team + trio)
            composite_score = 0.7 * cf_score + 0.3 * team_cohesion

            recommendations.append(ScoredRecommendation(...))

        # Return top K
        return sorted(recommendations, reverse=True)[:top_k]
```

**Scoring details:**
```python
def _cf_similarity_score(self, user_team, candidate_trio):
    """Average similarity between user's Pokémon and candidate trio."""
    similarities = []
    for user_mon in user_team:
        for candidate_mon in candidate_trio:
            sim = self.cf_model.get_similarity(user_mon, candidate_mon)
            similarities.append(sim)
    return mean(similarities)  # Range: [0, 1]

def _team_cohesion_score(self, full_team):
    """How well all 6 Pokémon work together."""
    similarities = []
    for mon1, mon2 in combinations(full_team, 2):
        sim = self.cf_model.get_similarity(mon1, mon2)
        similarities.append(sim)
    return mean(similarities)  # Range: [0, 1]
```

#### 3. `TeamDataGenerator` (`src/data_generator.py`)

Generates synthetic training teams.

```python
class TeamDataGenerator:
    def generate_dataset(self, n_teams: int = 1500):
        teams = []
        for _ in range(n_teams):
            archetype = random.choice(self.archetypes)
            team = self._sample_team(archetype)
            teams.append(team)
        return teams

    def _sample_team(self, archetype):
        # Pick 3-4 from core, fill rest with flexibles
        core_picks = random.sample(archetype["core"], k=random.randint(3, 4))
        flex_picks = random.sample(archetype["flexibles"], k=6 - len(core_picks))
        return core_picks + flex_picks
```

**Archetypes used:**
- Balance (Landorus-T, Toxapex, Heatran core)
- Hyper Offense (Dragapult, Iron Valiant, Great Tusk)
- Bulky Offense (Garchomp, Corviknight, Slowking-Galar)
- Stall (Toxapex, Clodsire, Corviknight)
- Rain (Barraskewda, Pelipper, Archaludon)
- Sun (Torkoal, Walking Wake, Roaring Moon)

This creates realistic team patterns based on actual competitive strategies.

## Scoring Formula

### Final Score

```
Composite Score = 0.7 × CF_Similarity + 0.3 × Team_Cohesion
```

**Why this weighting?**
- **CF Similarity (70%):** Prioritizes trios that complement the user's team
- **Team Cohesion (30%):** Ensures the final 6 Pokémon work well together

### Example Calculation

**User team:** `[Garchomp, Raging Bolt, Great Tusk]`
**Candidate trio:** `[Kingambit, Gholdengo, Corviknight]`

**Step 1: Calculate CF Similarity**
```python
similarities = [
    sim(Garchomp, Kingambit),    # 0.65
    sim(Garchomp, Gholdengo),    # 0.58
    sim(Garchomp, Corviknight),  # 0.52
    sim(Raging Bolt, Kingambit), # 0.71
    sim(Raging Bolt, Gholdengo), # 0.68
    sim(Raging Bolt, Corviknight), # 0.45
    sim(Great Tusk, Kingambit),  # 0.48
    sim(Great Tusk, Gholdengo),  # 0.55
    sim(Great Tusk, Corviknight) # 0.62
]
CF_Similarity = mean(similarities) = 0.58
```

**Step 2: Calculate Team Cohesion**
```python
# All 6 Pokémon: [Garchomp, Raging Bolt, Great Tusk, Kingambit, Gholdengo, Corviknight]
all_pairs_similarities = [
    sim(Garchomp, Raging Bolt), sim(Garchomp, Great Tusk), ...,
    sim(Gholdengo, Corviknight)  # 15 pairs total
]
Team_Cohesion = mean(all_pairs_similarities) = 0.52
```

**Step 3: Calculate Composite Score**
```python
Composite = 0.7 × 0.58 + 0.3 × 0.52 = 0.406 + 0.156 = 0.562
```

**Final recommendation:**
```markdown
### #1 - Score: 0.562

**Trio:** Kingambit, Gholdengo, Corviknight

**Breakdown:**
- CF Similarity: 0.580
- Team Cohesion: 0.520
```

## Comparison with ML-Hybrid Approach

| Aspect | **Collaborative Filtering** | **ML-Hybrid** |
|--------|----------------------------|---------------|
| **Training Data** | Synthetic teams (1,500) | Synthetic teams (10,000) |
| **Features** | Co-occurrence patterns only | Type coverage, meta matchups, roles |
| **Domain Knowledge** | None (learns from patterns) | Extensive (type charts, movesets, usage stats) |
| **Model Type** | Cosine similarity (unsupervised) | Gradient Boosting (supervised) |
| **Explainability** | "These Pokémon appear together often" | "Covers Fire weakness, handles Garchomp" |
| **Adaptability** | High (learns any patterns in data) | Medium (relies on feature engineering) |
| **Interpretability** | Low (hard to know *why* similarity is high) | High (explicit features like type coverage) |
| **Training Time** | ~15 seconds | ~15 seconds |
| **Model Size** | 10 MB (100×100 similarity matrix) | 10 MB (sklearn model) |

### When to Use Each Approach?

**Use Collaborative Filtering when:**
- ✅ You want a **data-driven** approach without domain expertise
- ✅ The meta shifts frequently (CF adapts automatically)
- ✅ You have good training data (real teams or realistic synthetic data)

**Use ML-Hybrid when:**
- ✅ You have **domain knowledge** to encode (type charts, roles)
- ✅ You need **explainable** recommendations (why was X recommended?)
- ✅ Training data is limited (features help generalize better)

**In this project:**
- **CF approach:** Explores pattern-based recommendations
- **ML-Hybrid approach:** Provides interpretable, rule-based + learned recommendations

Both approaches produce valid recommendations, but with different trade-offs.

## Strengths & Limitations

### Strengths

1. **No Domain Knowledge Required**
   - Don't need to understand type matchups, competitive roles, or the meta
   - Algorithm learns patterns automatically from team data

2. **Discovers Unexpected Synergies**
   - May find Pokémon combinations that work well but aren't obvious from type charts
   - Example: Garchomp + Heatran (covers each other's weaknesses) learned from patterns, not rules

3. **Adapts to Meta Shifts**
   - If new Pokémon become popular, retrain on updated teams
   - No need to manually update type charts or role definitions

4. **Simple and Fast**
   - Cosine similarity is computationally cheap
   - Training takes ~15 seconds, predictions are instant

### Limitations

1. **Requires Training Data**
   - Need 1,500+ teams to build reliable similarity matrix
   - Synthetic data may not perfectly match real competitive patterns
   - **Mitigation:** Use archetypes based on actual strategies (Balance, HO, Stall)

2. **Popularity Bias**
   - Popular Pokémon (Garchomp, Landorus-T) appear in many teams
   - May get recommended even if not optimal for your specific team
   - **Mitigation:** Cosine similarity normalizes for popularity to some extent

3. **Cold Start Problem**
   - New or rare Pokémon won't have enough co-occurrence data
   - Can't recommend Pokémon that don't appear in training teams
   - **Mitigation:** Focus on OU tier (100 most-used Pokémon)

4. **Less Explainable**
   - "Garchomp and Landorus-T appear together often" is less actionable than "Landorus-T covers your Fire weakness"
   - Users may not understand *why* similarity is high
   - **Mitigation:** Add explanation UI showing co-occurrence patterns and team cohesion

5. **No Guarantees on Coverage**
   - CF doesn't explicitly check type coverage or role balance
   - May recommend teams with overlapping weaknesses
   - **Trade-off:** Learns implicit patterns (teams with good coverage appear more often)

---

## Conclusion

Collaborative filtering offers a **data-driven alternative** to rule-based team building. By learning from team patterns, it can discover synergies without needing competitive expertise. However, it trades explainability and guarantees for adaptability and simplicity.

**This project demonstrates both approaches:**
- **pokemon-cf-recommender (this repo):** Pure collaborative filtering
- **pokemon-team-recommender (ML-Hybrid):** Domain knowledge + machine learning

Both are valid strategies for building competitive teams, each with unique strengths. Try both and see which recommendations you prefer!
